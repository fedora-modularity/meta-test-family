How to Contribute
==================

If you are interested in contributing to MTF, the best way is to report a bug or propose a new feature that interests you and submit a patch for it. We use `GitHub Issues`_ for sharing bugs and feature ideas. The `MTF GitHub repository`_ should be forked into your personal GitHub account where all work will be done. Any changes should be submitted through the pull request process. For more information on how to contibute, please read our `Contributing Guidelines`_.

MTF is written in Python. While you do not need to be a Python expert to contribute, it would be advantageous to run through the `Python tutorial`_ if you are new to Python or programming in general.

Some knowledge of git and GitHub is useful as well. Documentation on both is available on the `GitHub help page`_ .
