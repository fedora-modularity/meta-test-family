# Upstream Test Metadata PoC
This project defines file strucuture and tooling to work with general test metadata.


## User Stories
* __US1:__ Schedule/__Filter__ testsets based on some filters because you have limited resources(eg. not have enought time, just tests what does not need network, because you are offine)
    * I want to select some cases based on tags
    * I want to select some cases based on relevancy
* __US2:__ Find/__Agregate__ uncovered parts in testsuite to write new tests, or report status of testsuite to managers
    * I want to see acual coverage for component
    * I want to see uncovered parts
* __US3:__ General format allows us more, Describing tests inside source code is `programming lang` specific and harder to handle
    * I want cover simple usecases in as simplest way as possible
    * I want to  be able to write complex structure as well
    * I want to have it human readable
    * I want to see some examples

## Scope of project
* filter test set for frameworks
* create test coverage report

### What we covers
* __Test case filtering__, based on relevancy and tags
* __Test coverage__ document and analysis.
* __Example__  [component](examples/general-component/tests)
* __Tooling__ to work with this example, to show abilities
* __Modular__ various tools can define own items for each test and parse it how you want.

## Out of scope
* __NO schedule tests__ - it is in scope of framework: (eg. avocado, unittest, py.test, restraint) and also it is part of [Invoking test initiative](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/InvokingTests)
* __NO dependency solving__ - each framework has own dependency solving (eg. python pypi deps, rpm dependencies in specfile)
    * optional scope: it can be part of scope here after some discussion, but just as an optional feature
* __NO test linking__ - each framework has to known how to interpret filtered tests format (eg. set of: local files, python classes, URLs)
    * optional scope: could be transform formats to format of selected framework (backend) (eg. download tests from URLs and store it locally)

## How it works
* Tree structure of metadata splitted to two types
* can use one metadata file, or split metadata file to each test or use combination of both solution.
* Two type of `metadata.yaml`
    * __general__ - fully descriptive file for writing general info about component and testing and whatever you want - [metadata.yaml](examples/general-component/tests/metadata.yaml)
    * __test__ - basic metadata for test, it has same value as any test in `tests` element [metadata.yaml](examples/general-component/tests/sanity/metadata.yaml)


## Installation
```
sudo make install
```

## Self-Check
```
sudo make check
```

## Usage
 * Two tools: `tmet-filter` and `tmet-agregator`
 * Swithc to example directory `examples/general-component/tests` and try them

## Config examples

### Simple config
As output there will be two tests independent on backend framework

```
document: test-metadata
subtype: general
import_tests:
    - "/bin/true"
    - "/bin/false"
```

### Simple Config with MTF Linters
tag filetrs with imported test and enabled MTF modulelint and import all tests (relatively to base dir)

```
document: test-metadata
subtype: general
enable_lint: True
tag_filters:
    - "add,-rem"
    - "dockerfilelint"
import_tests:
    - "*.py"
```

### Configs just for tests
when you want to have metadata to each test put similar config to directory (coverage inclueded)
```
document: test-metadata
subtype: test
source: generaltest.py
relevancy:
  - rule 1
  - rule 2
description: some general test doing
envvars:
  ATOMIC: link to atomic container
```

### Complex config with coverage
 see [example component](examples/general-component/tests/metadata.yaml)

#### Example output of commands

```
$ tmet-agregator
50%
```

```
$ tmet-agregator -a md

## Overall Coverage: 50%
```

```
$ tmet-filter 
file://general/generaltest.py file://networking/use_tcp/ file://networking/use_udp/ https://github.com/fedora-modularity/meta-test-family.git file://options/fedora_test/fedora_specifictest.py file://options/new_option/ file://sanity/generaltest.py file://sanity/SSSSSS/
```

```
$ tmet-filter --help
usage: tmet-filter [-h] [-r RELEVANCY] [-t TAGS]

Filter and print tests

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -r RELEVANCY  apply relevancy filtering, expect environment specification
  -t TAGS       apply tags filtering, expect tags in DNF form
```
